# Potential Issues with Confluence Integration

## TypeScript and Build Process

1. **Missing Type Declarations**: 
   - Type declarations are missing for both `marked` and `ignore` modules
   - Fix: Run `npm install @types/marked @types/ignore` to install the required type definitions

2. **TypeScript Build Required**: 
   - The integration uses TypeScript files that need to be compiled before use
   - Users need to run `npm run build` before using the Confluence features
   - The `confluenceCommand.js` module attempts to dynamically import either the compiled or source TS files, but this may be unreliable

3. **Import Path Extensions**: 
   - The code uses `.js` extensions in import paths (e.g., `import { markdownToConfluence } from './markdownConverter.js'`) 
   - This might cause issues when TypeScript tries to resolve these imports

## Dependency Management

1. **Dependency Versions**: 
   - Some dependencies might have version compatibility issues:
     - `glob` v10.3.10 is used, but the code might be compatible with v8.x (which @types/glob is for)
     - TypeScript v5.3.3 might have issues with the ESM setup

2. **Missing Dependencies in package.json**:
   - While we added the main dependencies, others might be missing from the package.json

## API and Configuration

1. **Confluence API Compatibility**: 
   - The integration is built for a specific version of the Confluence API
   - Different Confluence instances (Server vs Cloud) might have different API endpoints or requirements

2. **Authentication Tokens**: 
   - The code assumes environment variables will be available for tokens
   - Users might not properly set up these environment variables before running the integration

## Runtime Issues

1. **Dynamic Module Loading**: 
   - The code attempts to dynamically load modules which can be brittle:
   ```javascript
   async function loadConfluenceExporter() {
     try {
       return await import('../dist/exporters/confluenceExporter.js');
     } catch (err) {
       try {
         return await import('../src/exporters/confluenceExporter.js');
       } catch (err2) {
         throw new Error('Failed to load Confluence exporter...');
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Some error handling could be more robust, especially for API calls
   - Network errors or API rate limiting are not specifically handled

## Testing

1. **Limited Test Coverage**: 
   - While basic tests are implemented, they may not cover all edge cases
   - Mock responses might not accurately represent real API responses

2. **E2E Testing**: 
   - No true end-to-end tests that actually interact with a Confluence instance

## Usage Considerations

1. **File Processing**:
   - Directory traversal for finding source files might not work as expected on all platforms
   - The `ruleLoader.ts` implementation for finding CursorRules and respecting ignore patterns is complex and could have edge cases

2. **Markdown to Confluence HTML Conversion**:
   - The conversion from Markdown to Confluence-compatible HTML is complex
   - Some Confluence-specific macros might not render correctly
   - Complex formatting might be lost in the conversion process

## Possible Fixes

1. Make sure to install all type dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install @types/marked @types/ignore
   ```

2. Update the import paths in TypeScript files to use explicit file extensions that TypeScript understands:
   - Consider using the `"moduleResolution": "node16"` or `"moduleResolution": "nodenext"` in tsconfig.json

3. Add a pre-build step or post-install script to compile TypeScript files:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "postinstall": "npm run build",
     "build": "tsc"
   }
   ```

4. Implement more robust error handling in the API calls, with clearer error messages and recovery strategies

5. Expand test coverage to include more realistic API responses and edge cases
