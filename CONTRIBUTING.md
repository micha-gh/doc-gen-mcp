Thank you for your interest in contributing to doc-gen-mcp!

## How to contribute

- **Report bugs:** Open an [issue](https://github.com/micha-gh/doc-gen-mcp/issues) with a clear description and, if possible, example input.
- **Feature requests:** Describe new ideas or improvements as an issue as well.
- **Pull Requests:**
  1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch (`feature/xyz` or `fix/abc`).
  2. Write or extend tests for your change.
  3. Describe in the PR what you changed and why.
  4. Follow the coding style (see below).

## Coding Style

- Use ES Modules (`import`/`export`).
- Write functional, testable functions where possible.
- Write and extend tests in the `test/` folder (Jest, `.test.mjs`).
- Document new commands and options in the README.

## Tests

- Run `npm test` before every PR and make sure all tests pass.
- New features should be covered by tests.

## Communication

- Be friendly and respectful (see Code of Conduct).
- Discuss major changes in an issue before starting work.
